# ultimate_battle
Gambling game (no real money needed) to bet on who will win out of all superheroes 1v1

## Info
The aim of the game is simple, make Â£1,000,000! 
Do this by betting on the winner of a 1v1 between a multitude of superheroes
The more fights won (or lost), the better (or worse) the odds will be.

If you run out of money - you'll get "pit of dispare" money, which is equal to the number of bets you've made, so you never really run out
And the more bets you make, the easier it'll be to climb back up once you inevitably lose it all.

## Setup (MAC and Linux)
clone the repo
cd into the repos directory
run "CHMOD 775 ./run_setup_mac_linux.sh"
run "sudo bash ./run_setup_mac_linux.sh"

## Setup (Windows)
run "run_setup_win.bat" as admin

## Play the game (MAC and Linux)
Ensure you're cd'd in the games directory
run "run_game_mac_linux.sh"
OR you can setup an alias to run this in an simple command 

## Play the game (Windows)
run in terminal or CMD "run_game_win.bat"

## Functionality to be added:
1. Experience - Each fight won or lost change the stats of the characters, so if the worst hero losses enough he/she will gain a boost
2. Cheat detection - No mucking around the values - although, you're only cheating yourself
3. Leader board - No idea how this'll be done but it's on a list, so there
4. More charcters - Simplified way to add new characters and stats (relative to their power etc)
