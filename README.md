# ultimate_battle
Gambling game (no real money needed) to bet on who will win out of all superheroes 1v1

## Setup
clone the repo
cd into the repos directory
Execute setup.py (cd run the command python setup.py

## Play the game
python run_game.py

## Info
The aim of the game is simple, make £1,000,000! 
Do this by betting on the winner of a 1v1 between a multitude of superheroes
The more fights won (or lost), the better (or worse) the odds will be.

If you run out of money - you'll get £10, so you never really run out

## Functionality to be added:
1. Experience - Each fight won or lost change the stats of the characters, so if the worst hero losses enough he/she will gain a boost
2. Cheat detection - No mucking around the values - although, you're only cheating yourself
3. Leader board - No idea how this'll be done but it's on a list, so there
4. More charcters - Simplified way to add new characters and stats (relative to their power etc)
